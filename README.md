# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Assignment-1
# There is a script to generate the usable data set in the scripts directory call get_and_clean_data.R. This script downloads, unzips, reads, cleanses, and filters the data so the plots can be reproduced at anytime.
# Plots can be found in the plots directory of this repository. All plots are PNG files per specification.
# All R codes to create each of the plots can be found in the scripts directory.
